Now that you've created a spell and cast it in Minecraft, you can take a look at the [Magikcraft API Documentation](http://apidoc.magikcraft.io). 

You can also search [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=magikcraft) and [GitHub](https://gist.github.com?q=MAGIKCRAFT) for Magikcraft content. 

When you are ready to go further, you can graduate to using the direct Bukkit API - the reference documentation is available at [bukkit.magikcraft.io](http://bukkit.magikcraft.io).



Here's an idea of what's possible in Magikcraft. These are Magikcraft spells written by Brisbane software developer Tim Smith - aka "_Abznak the Archmage_".
