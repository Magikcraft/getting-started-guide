# The Spellbook

The Spellbook is at https://play.magikcraft.io.

You can write your spells here, and also test them.

Each page of the spellbook can hold only one spell. Don't try to put more than one spell on a page!

You can create a new spell by deleting the spell that is in there already. Don't worry, it won't delete your spell from Minecraft if you saved it!
