# Some things that may help

## Console commands

In Minecraft, access the console by pressing the '/' (forward-slash) key.

In the console you can type commands. Anything with a forward-slash in front of it is a command. 

Sometimes you'll find clues in Magikcraft that start with a forward-slash. Type them in to see what they do.

## Chat

Press the 'T' key to access the chat console. When you type into the console with no forward-slash, your text is broadcast to other users on the server.

You can use this to ask for help from others.

## Clicking Links

You can also use the chat console to click on any links. Sometimes a command produces a link for you to click on. To click on it, hit the 'T' key, then click on the link.
