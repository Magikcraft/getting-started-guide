# How to Play Magikcraft

Magikcraft is about exploration and discovery. If you "_don't know what to do_" at times, don't worry. Keep moving through the environment looking for opportunities and clues.

Don't let "_not knowing what to do_" stop you. **Everything is discoverable**. 

And developing your ability to discover is the most powerful ability you'll have in software development, and in life.

If you find yourself stuck, stop and make a plan. Write down what you've already tried. When you do that, you'll often see something that you missed. 

Above all else - don't give up! It's about discovering something.
