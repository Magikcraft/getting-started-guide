# The Magikcraft Open Source Platform

The Magikcraft Open Source Platform is a platform for coding JavaScript in Minecraft. It integrates GitHub, in-browser editing of code, and immediate deployment to hosted Minecraft servers to deliver the world's most advanced JavaScript in Minecraft experience.

## Magikcraft Open Source Platform Servers

The following Magikcraft servers are part of the Magikcraft Open Source Platform:

Argentina - ar.open.magikcraft.io
Australia - au.open.magikcraft.io
Denmark - da.open.magikcraft.io
England - en.open.magikcraft.io
India - in.open.magikcraft.io
Ireland - ie.open.magikcraft.io
Japan - ja.open.magikcraft.io
Norway - no.open.magikcraft.io

Connect to them with a 1.11.2 Minecraft client.

The key difference between these servers and the server at play.magikcraft.io is that _API Creative Mode_ is enabled on these servers. This means that your code can access the fundamental objects in the Bukkit API using `magik.getSender()` and `magik.getPlugin()`.

## The Magikcraft Spellbook

The Magikcraft Spellbook is a micro-IDE (Integrated Development Environment) that runs in your web browser. It is accessible at [play.magikcraft.io](https://play.magikcraft.io). You use it to write spells (programs) to run on a Magikcraft server. You can also use it to write reusable APIs that other people can use.

## The Magikcraft API

The Magikcraft API is a high-level semantic API that is useful for both teaching and learning JavaScript and Minecraft programming.

The TypeScript definition files for the Magikcraft API are available from: [https://github.com/Magikcraft/apidocs](https://github.com/Magikcraft/apidocs).

You can also use the Magikcraft Spellbook and GitHub to develop your own APIs, and your own School of Magik.

## GitHub

GitHub is the world's social coding platform. It allows you to share and discover code, building on the innovation of others.

You can get a free GitHub account at [https://www.github.com](www.github.com).
